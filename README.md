<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="./src/assets/screenshots/desktop[alpha@1.0.0].png" width="600" />

Since the advent of smartphones, business cards and their needs are on the decline. Most of our routine-life activities are being replaced by smartphones or their competitive counterparts. It wouldn't be wrong to say that the internet has overtaken our lives and some things need to be remade and re-introduced.

Hence, we introduce digital business cards that aren't your ordinary paper cards, with an evergrowing supply of templates and professional designs that hold the power to make your eyes pause for a moment. The workflow is as simple as creating an account for google;

1. Create an account.

2. Set up your profile.

3. Select & Edit a card template.

4. Share, print, or download the card.

### Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) as the library.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as the database.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

We've got you covered in case you want to setup the app for yourself on your local machine. Follow these simple steps:

### Pre-requisites

Firstly, visit [supabase](https://app.supabase.io) and create yourself a new account/log in before creating a new project. Visit the [official docs](https://supabase.com/docs) to learn more. Once you're done with the project initialization, you'll be given a `URL` that points to your project and an `ANON_KEY` that is the public API key for your project. Hold onto these for a while.

Lastly, make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and you have access to atleast one of `npm` or `yarn`. You can check the installation by typing `node -v` in a terminal.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/devshot-dotcom/business-door.git
   ```

2. Select the directory in the terminal:

   ```sh
   cd business-door
   ```

3. Install the dependancies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file and place the variables you received from supabase as follows:

   ```py
   REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=<your-project-url>
   REACT_APP_DATABASE_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ```

5. Start the development server and you're good to go:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

### Additional Steps

You will need to create tables and insert data in the `supabase.storage` buckets to be able to successfully use the app's API. Further information on this will be presented soon.
